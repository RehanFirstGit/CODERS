                            Changing Expectations mission is to provide the highest impact STEM, computer coding, and artificial intelligence education
                            programs to inspire Black and Hispanic youth to pursue computing careers and tech entrepreneurship. Our programs are designed
                            to study and increase Black and Hispanic studentsâ€™ interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, sense of belonging and identity,
                            and intentions to persist in STEM and computer science education, including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
                            In support of our mission to broaden participation of communities traditionally underrepresented in STEM and computing,
                            we provide Information Technology (IT) sales and technical support services by creating work-based learning opportunities
                            through a Paid Pre-Apprenticeship for Black and Hispanic Youth.
